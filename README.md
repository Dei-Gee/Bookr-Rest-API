# BOOKR (Rest-API)
This is a Rest API built in Java and bootstrapped with Springboot from start.spring.io

## Development Environment Setup
Follow the instructions below in order to run the app Rest API. You can test the API endpoints using PostMan. 

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Go to **File -> Import** in Eclipse IDE and select **Existing Maven Project**
3. The API runs on port 8888 by default. This can be seen in the application.properties     file under *src/main/resources*.
4. Run the main class in the "MainAPIClass" package as a spring application.
5. You'll know if it is running correctly if you get a *white label error* in the           browser and the last line in the terminal says it is running with no errors.  

**Note: This API will eventually be deployed on Heroku**
